  abstract =     {Interactions between biochemical reactions lie at
                  the heart of functioning of a living cell. In order
                  to formalize these interactions we introduce
                  reaction systems. We motivate them by explicitely
                  stating a number of assumptions/axioms that (we
                  believe) hold for a great number of biochemical
                  reactions - we point out that these assumptions are
                  very different from the ones underlying traditional
                  models of computation. The paper provides the basic
                  definitions, illustrates them by biology and
                  computer science oriented examples, relates reaction
                  systems to some traditional models of computation,
                  and proves some basic properties of reaction
                  systems.},
