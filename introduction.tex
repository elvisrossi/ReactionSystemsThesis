\begin{chapter}{Introduction}
  Reaction Systems (RSs) are a successful computational framework inspired by biological system.
  The underlying idea is that the interactions between biochemical reactions as well as the functioning of single reactions are based on the mechanisms of facilitation and inhibition.

  A Reaction System consists of a set of entities and a set of reactions over them. Each reaction produces some set of entities P (called products) if enabled, meaning if a set R (called reactants) is wholly present and if a set I (called inhibitors) of entities is completely absent.
  The use of inhibitors induces non-monotonic behaviors that are difficult to analyze.
  This work aims to build software that aids in the study and analysis of certain classes of Reaction Systems.

  Entities can also be provided by an external context sequence to simulate \textit{in silico} biological experiment.
